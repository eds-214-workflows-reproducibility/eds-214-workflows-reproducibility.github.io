## Further reading

-   @stoudt2021 describe how analytical workflows evolve, what they look like in the end, and how they're necessary for data-intensive science.

-   @lowndes2017 present a case study on their own team-based research. They show how an emphasis on reproducibility improves *efficiency* as well as transparency.
