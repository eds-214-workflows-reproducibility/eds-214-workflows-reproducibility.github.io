## Workflow organization

* Let's look at some examples of workflows on GitHub
* All focus on nearby marine ecosystems, but the principles apply to any subject
* Keep your eyes peeled for these four components:
  * Raw data
  * Code
  * Outputs
  * Documentation

## Kelp me kelp you
* Krumhansl et al. 2016 PNAS
* https://github.com/kelpecosystems/global_kelp_time_series
* Fig 4: kelp forests declining globally

## MPAs protect against marine heatwaves
* Benedetti-Cecchi et al. 2024 NatComms
* https://github.com/bencecc/ReefFishStability/tree/v1
* Fig 3a,b: In MPAs, reef fish stability is affected more by remoteness than heatwaves. Pattern reversed in open areas.

## MPAs _don't_ protect against marine heatwaves
* Smith et al. 2023 GCB
* https://github.com/NCEAS/ca-mpa
* Fig 3: Only rocky intertidal sites exhibited resistance and recovery in MPAs
  
## Workflow organization jigsaw pt 1
* Count off 1-3
* Find 2-3 other students with your same number (i.e., a group with 3 1s, a group with 4 2s, etc.)
* Each group will look at one of the three workflows above
  * 1: Krumhansl et al. 2016 PNAS
  * 2: Benedetti-Cecchi et al. 2024 NatComms
  * 3: Smith et al. 2023 GCB
* Try to find the following four components in the workflow:
  * Raw data
  * Code
  * Outputs
  * Documentation
* For each component, make a note of:
  * The name of the folder(s) containing it
  * Connections with other components
  * How you found that component (intuition? documentation? parsing code?)

## Workflow organization jigsaw pt 2
* Now, form groups with one student from each workflow
* Each person shares what they found in their workflow
* As a group, write down 2 traits of a workflow that make it _easy_ and _challenging_ to find things (4 traits total)
* Provide examples for each
* I will randomly call on a group to share

## What are the goals for workflow organization?
* Reproducibility
  * Another scientist (including _Future You_) should be able to repeat your analysis.
* Maintainability
  * You should be able to jump back in to editing your analysis, even if you haven’t looked at it in a while
  * DOC101 lecture TikTok 
* Collaboration
  * You should be able to share your analysis methods and results with others
  
## Tools that help with workflow organization
* GitHub
  * Version control - track your (and your collaborators') changes
  * Issues - a built-in to-do list directly connected to code _and_ conversations
  * Branches and pull requests - work in parallel and merge your work _as seamlessly as possible_
  * GitHub Pages - a website for sharing your analysis with collaborators
* Folder organization
  * It’s less important _which_ system you pick than it is to be _consistent_
  * Free up cognitive load!
    * Brainpower you spent figuring out where to put or find files - reallocated to your actual science
  * Follow conventions
    * By playing nice with others you get to use their tools

## Introducing: The FlukeAndFeather Workflow Organization System TM
* You have before you a shuffled collection of folders and files
* You have _no context_ other than their names
* With a partner, try to:
  * Organize the folders and files hierarchically
  * Briefly describe what you think the purpose of each folder/file is
