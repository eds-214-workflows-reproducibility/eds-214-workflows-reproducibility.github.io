# Documenting Scientific Code and Data - 50-Minute Lecture Outline

## LEGO Blueprints

Active learning exercise with four steps.

1. Build (in pairs)
  Form pairs and receive LEGOs
  Each pair builds a LEGO structure. Get weird with it!
  Take a picture of the _finished product_
  Destroy the LEGO structure
2. Copy (in pairs)
  Switch legos and pictures with another pair
  Try to replicate the structure using only the picture
  Take notes about challenges encountered
3. Share (in quads)
  Pairs compare original and finished structures
  Take notes about what was different
  Describe 2-3 pieces of documentation that would have helped
4. Debrief (as a class)
  Draw two axes. Left-to-right: Acquisition to Application. Top-to-bottom: Action to Cognition
  Place the documentation pieces on the axes
  
## The Diátaxis map

A framework for structuring documentation into four distinct areas: 

* Tutorials
* How-to guides
* Reference
* Explanation

(Place them on the map)

Each area serves a different purpose and audience.

A _tool_ needs all four areas. An _analysis_ probably needs a subset. Why? (Think-pair-share)

## Documentation types

### README

Things you should always include in your GitHub repository READMEs:

NOTE: these core elements are required for all MEDS-related homework assignments and projects

Provide an example

1. A short, but descriptive title 
2. A brief explanation of the repository’s purpose
3. A concise description of what’s housed in the repository
4. Details regarding data access
5. A list of authors or current contributors (for collaborative work)
6. References 

### Code comments

Provide an example

Types of comments. [add examples]

* Headers
* Inline
* Functions
  * Parameters
  * Return value
  * Example usage

### Code style

Provide an example

Readability -> Comprehension -> Reproducibility

Consistency is key! (Just like workflow folder organization)

Considerations:

* Object naming
* Spacing and layout
* Writing and calling functions
* Comments!
