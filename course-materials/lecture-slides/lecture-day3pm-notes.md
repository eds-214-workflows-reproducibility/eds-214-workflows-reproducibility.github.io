# Collaboration with GitHub

## Recap

This morning you learned how to create, work in, and merge branches. These operations promote collaboration while working in the local git repository.

GitHub offers project management tools that integrate with git features like branches and commits.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Use Issues to describe, discuss, and track code changes
* Compare the shared and distinct concepts of branching/merging and forking/pull requests
* Share your outputs on GitHub Pages

## Code evolves

[column 1]

Writing an analysis is an exploratory process, filled with dead ends.

Lists of bugs and discussions about to-do items easily get lost.

We need a project management tool to link issues, discussions, and code changes!

## Issues

five slides, progressing through images/day3/issues

You will open, discuss, and close issues in the interactive session.

## Branch/Merge vs Fork/Pull Request

Branching and merging are local operations that help you manage your own work.

Forking and pull requests are remote operations that help you manage work with others.

Fork/Pull Request is a recommended system for your Capstone!

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free service that easily gives your projects web presence.

Great for sharing your work with others.

URL easy! Hunting for email attachments hard!

You will use GitHub Pages for class assignments, Capstone, and your portfolio.
