## {#welcome data-menu-title="Welcome to EDS 214!"} 

[Welcome to EDS 214!]{.slide-title}

<hr>

This is a class about workflows and reproducibility

<br> 

. . . 

[The workflow is the fundamental unit of data science]{.body-text-m}

<br> 

. . . 

[Reproducibility ensures workflows don't become dead ends]{.body-text-m}

## {#instructor data-menu-title="Hi, I'm Max"} 

[Hi, I'm Max]{.slide-title}

<hr>

* I started as a computer scientist
* Software engineer at Microsoft
* Four years as a field biologist (seabirds, mostly)
* Six years grad school, specializing in data science
  * GIS at SFSU
  * Marine biology at Stanford

. . . 

* My specialty was biologging - animal-borne sensors for detecting location, behavior, and physiology
* Now my research is about open science, sharing data and code, and the ethics of proprietary data

## {#teaching data-menu-title="But really what I love is teaching!"} 

[But really what I love is teaching!]{.slide-title}

<hr>

* In addition to the MEDS program, I also teach in the new marine science undergraduate major
* My favorite part of my job is working with students

## {#what-is-workflow1 data-menu-title="What is a workflow?"} 

[What is a workflow?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**THINK** Take 1 minute to write down your own definition. Consider:

  * What are the components? How do they fit together?
  * Who is the audience?
  * What would the alternative be?

**PAIR** Turn to your neighbor and discuss your definitions

**SHARE** I will randomly call on a pair to share one shared element and one differing element

## {#what-is-reproducibility data-menu-title="What is reproducibility?"} 

[What is reproducibility?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

> We define reproducibility to mean computational reproducibility â€” obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis

[@nasem2019]{.body-text-xs}

**DEBATE** With your neighbor, discuss: does reproducibility matter if you're not doing academic research? 

* What if you work for a public utility, a non-governmental organization, or a private firm? 
* Articulate one argument for and against the importance of reproducibility.
* I will randomly call on a pair to share
