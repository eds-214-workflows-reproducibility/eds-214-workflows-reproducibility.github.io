[What is a workflow?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**THINK** Take 1 minute to write down your own definition. Consider:

  * What are the components? How do they fit together?
  * Who is the audience?
  * What would the alternative be?

**PAIR** Turn to your neighbor and discuss your definitions

**SHARE** I will randomly call on a pair to share one shared element and one differing element

## {#what-is-reproducibility data-menu-title="What is reproducibility?"} 

[What is reproducibility?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

> We define reproducibility to mean computational reproducibility â€” obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis

[@nasem2019]{.body-text-xs}

**DEBATE** With your neighbor, discuss: does reproducibility matter if you're not doing academic research? 

* What if you work for a public utility, a non-governmental organization, or a private firm? 
* Articulate one argument for and against the importance of reproducibility.
* I will randomly call on a pair to share
