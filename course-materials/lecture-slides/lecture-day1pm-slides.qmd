Let's look at some examples of workflows on GitHub

All focus on nearby marine ecosystems, but the principles apply to any subject

Keep your eyes peeled for these four components:

-   Raw data
-   Code
-   Outputs
-   Documentation

-   Count off 1-3
-   Find 2-3 other students with your same number (i.e., a group with 3 1s, a group with 4 2s, etc.)
-   Each group will look at one of the three workflows above
    -   <https://github.com/kelpecosystems/global_kelp_time_series>
    -   <https://github.com/bencecc/ReefFishStability/tree/v1>

Try to find the following four components in the workflow:

-   Raw data
-   Code
-   Outputs
-   Documentation

For each component, make a note of:

-   The name of the folder(s) containing it
-   How you found that component (intuition? documentation? parsing code?)

[Workflow organization jigsaw pt 2]{.slide-title}

-   Now, form groups with one student from each workflow
-   Each person shares what they found in their workflow
-   As a group, write down 2 traits of a workflow that make it *easy* and *challenging* to find things (4 traits total)
-   Provide examples for each
-   I will randomly call on a group to share

[What are the goals for workflow organization?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

. . .

**Reproducibility**

Another scientist (including *Future You*) should be able to repeat your analysis.

. . .

**Maintainability**

You should be able to jump back in to editing your analysis, even if you haven't looked at it in a while

. . . 

**Collaboration**

You should be able to share your analysis methods and results with others

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  {#tools-that-help data-menu-title="Tools that help with workflow organization"}

[Tools that help with workflow organization]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**GitHub**

. . .

-   Version control - track your (and your collaborators') changes

. . .

-   Issues - a built-in to-do list directly connected to code *and* conversations

. . .

-   Branches and pull requests - work in parallel and merge your work *as seamlessly as possible*

. . .

-   GitHub Pages - a website for sharing your analysis with collaborators

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  {#tools-that-help-2 data-menu-title="Tools that help with workflow organization"}

[Tools that help with workflow organization]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**Folder organization**

. . .

-   It's less important *which* system you pick than it is to be *consistent*

. . .

-   Free up cognitive load!
    -   Brainpower you spent figuring out where to put or find files - reallocated to your actual science
    
. . .

-   Follow conventions
    -   By playing nice with others you get to use their tools

[Introducing: The FlukeAndFeather Workflow Organization System™]{.slide-title}

<hr>

-   You have before you a shuffled collection of folders and files
-   You have *no context* other than their names
-   With a partner, try to:
    -   Organize the folders and files hierarchically
    -   Briefly describe what you think the purpose of each folder/file is
    -   Use the two blank cards to add two files to the project
-   We will discuss your results in groups

- Combine pairs
- Choose a notetaker
- Share and combine into a single solution
- Notetaker writes down:
    - One example of differing solutions
    - How you decided which solution to use
    - One remaining question about a file/folder
