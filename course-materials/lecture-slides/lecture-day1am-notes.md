## Welcome to EDS 214

* This is a class about workflows and reproducibility
* The workflow is the fundamental unit of data science
* Reproducibility ensures workflows don't become dead ends
* The concepts and skills in this class will keep coming up in future classes and for the rest of your career

## Hi, I'm Max

* I started as a computer scientist
* Software engineer at Microsoft
* Four years as a field biologist (seabirds, mostly)
* Six years grad school, specializing in data science
  * GIS at SFSU
  * Marine biology at Stanford
* My specialty was biologging - animal-borne sensors for detecting location, behavior, and physiology
* Now my research is about open science, sharing data and code, and the ethics of proprietary data
* But really what I love is teaching!
* In addition to the MEDS program, I also teach in the new marine science undergraduate major
* My favorite part of my job is working with students
  * I would love it if you set up a meeting with me to tell me about your background, your interests, and your motivations for being here

## What is this class about?

* What is a workflow?
  * Think-pair-share activity
  * Data, code, modeling, communication
  * The final workflow masks a trajectory of exploration and dead ends (Stoudt et al. 2021 doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008770)
* What is reproducibility?
  * Does it matter if you're not doing academic research?
  * Debate activity
  * Reproducibility is the ability to repeat a workflow and get the same results
  * Global and local goals
    * "reproducibility as a mechanism for local knowledge transfer and collaboration, particularly as regards efficient software reuse" (Feinberg et al. 2020 doi:10.1145/3392840)

## How does it work?

* Beginning today, try to reproduce a workflow
* Lectures and hands-on activities for:
  * Automation
  * Organization
  * Documentation
  * Scale(ation)
  * Collaboration
* Specification-based grading
  * No points out of 100
  * A rubric of specifications (specs) for your final project
  * Meet (or exceed) specs and participate in class - get an A
  * Feedback loops are critical (no one-and-done)
  * You'll see more spec-based grading in other MEDS classes

## Testimonial from Bekah??

* Question: where are humpbacks in SF Bay most susceptible to ship strikes?
* Problem: model eats a lot of data with extensive pre-processing and subjective parameters. 
  * Time consuming to iterate and incorporate feedback.
  * Easily becomes tangled - verifying results is hard!
* Solution: instead of a point-and-click solution in ArcGIS, a well-organized, reproducible workflow in R.
* Today: Bekah is Research Associate with the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, MA. Still doing field work and data analysis to protect whales in coastal waters with high human impacts.
