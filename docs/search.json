    "text": "Course Description\nThe generation and analysis of environmental data is often a complex, multi-step process that may involve the collaboration of many people. Increasingly, data scientists use tools that document and help to organize workflows to ensure reproducibility, shareability, and transparency of the results. This course will introduce students to the conceptual organization of workflows (including code, documents, and data) as a way to conduct reproducible analyses.\nThese concepts will be combined with the practice of various software tools and collaborative coding techniques to develop and manage multi-step analytical workflows as a team.\n\n\n\n\nConceptual model of an analytical workflow.

(2000): make spaghetti code.\n\nYou can think of spaghetti as the alternative to a workflow. Instead of a well-organized analysis with clear connections between data, code, and outputs, spaghetti jumbles all these components together.\nImagine you want to change one part of your analysis. Perhaps you received some new data, or a collaborator suggests trying a different type of statistical model. Simply figuring out which lines of code need your attention is challenging when it‚Äôs all spaghetti. What‚Äôs worse, when you change one thing there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll break a lot of other things downstream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSpaghetti sounds pretty bad, doesn‚Äôt it? While it‚Äôs true that you don‚Äôt want your finished product to look like spaghetti, it‚Äôs often a necessary intermediate step. Science is a creative and iterative process. We often don‚Äôt know exactly what we need to do before we begin. As we explore, we create spaghetti. By creating spaghetti we develop our conceptual understanding of what our workflow should look like. Only then can we begin making a well-organized workflow."
